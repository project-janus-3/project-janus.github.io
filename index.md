## Community Feedback

We are intrested in your expirence using Project Janus! If you would like, please take a couple of minutes to fill out the [Project Janus Feedback Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfAI9DCwE6x5gdz6fo2SrTYMApu4G3tktQeBigOvmJ6uvx4yQ/viewform). It contains only 5 short questions and will help us understand how to improve the system.

Based on the feedback we recieved, we  think this version of the app is sucessful, however, there are still ways we can improve. Some users pointed out the simplicity and ease of use of the website. One of our intentions was to make the navigation of the webiste straight-forward. The first thing the user sees when they open the webiste is the landing page: it gives a breif statement about the purpose of our project and includes a button to help the user get started. The navbar at the top of the screen is also very simple, it is custom-taioled to each user group (user / company / admin). This ensures that all the important information is directly accessible to the user. Another positve feedback we recieved was about the browse page, some users commented that the layout made it easy to explore all the different companies. They suggested that we add a search bar, or a way to sort / filter the companies, we think this is a great idea, and will be working to implement it in the future. Moving on, we recieved some contructive feedback on the functionality of the website. Some users reported that they had trouble with signing-up. This was a known issue as we were working on the project, we were (hopefully) able to resolve it. Another user reported that the loading time between pages was long, or that they had to press a button more than one time for it to work. We think this is a Vercel related issue, with future updates, we hope to make the expirence more smooth. Additonally, we hope to add a feature that lets students connect companies, or each other (similar to Linkedin). This would allow direct interaction between students and company recruiters, eliminating the need for extrenal communication. It could also allow students to talk between themselves, they could share companies they have intrest in or even discuss interview tips. Overall, we are happy with the current version of our webiste, this additoinal feedback will help us improve and polish the wbeiste in the future.
